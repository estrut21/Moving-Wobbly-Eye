# Moving-Wobbly-Eye
Moving eyeball necklace

This pendant is crated by a mechanism driven using a micro motor and it will be powered through a hidden batter in the clasp, allowing the eyeball to rotate and mirror movement based on in real life.


Core funtions:
- Lifelike eyeball pendant which looks like a realistic eye in the center of the necklace.
- Motorized movement with a hidden micro motor makes the eyeball rotate or wobble.
- Battery powered runs on CR2032 coin cell batteries, hidden in the clasp or back of the pendant.
- On/Off control battery holder includes a switch to turn the necklace on or off easily.
- Wearable jewelry pendant hangs on a standard necklace chain so it functions as both art and accessory.
- Modular design components (motor, eyeball cabochon, bezel tray) can be swapped or customized.
- Dual-purpose aesthetic works as a halloween prop or a techy wearable art project.
